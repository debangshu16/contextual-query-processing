# contextual-query-processing

This was a mini project for the course Information Retrieval taught at CMI, 2020. 
In this project, we have considered an approach to use contextual information of the query to enhance the cosine
similarity based search engine of a vector space model. Based on the predicted context of the query, we find
out the documents which are relevant with respect to that context. Then, we simply modify our query using
Rocchio feedback mechanism. We compare this method with original cosine similarity based model and see the
improvement in Mean Average Precision (MAP).
